ML-Lab

This repository contains various machine learning models and datasets used for experimentation and learning purposes. The code is primarily written in Python and Jupyter notebooks, utilizing popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.

Project Overview
The repository contains the following:

Datasets:
Iris.csv: The famous Iris dataset used for classification tasks.
Mall_Customers.csv: A dataset used for customer segmentation tasks.
Salarydataset.ipynb: A salary prediction dataset.
WineQT.csv: A dataset for predicting wine quality.
Notebooks:
k-mean.ipynb: Implements K-Means Clustering for customer segmentation.
naivebayes.ipynb: Implements the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification.
svm.ipynb: Implements Support Vector Machines for classification tasks.
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed to run the code:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If there is no requirements.txt file, you can manually install the packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Usage
You can open the Jupyter notebooks using the following command:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Once inside the notebook interface, you can navigate to the relevant .ipynb files and run the cells interactively.

Notebooks Overview
K-Means Clustering (k-mean.ipynb)
This notebook performs customer segmentation using K-Means Clustering on the Mall_Customers.csv dataset.

Naive Bayes Classification (naivebayes.ipynb)
Here, a Naive Bayes classifier is implemented to perform classification tasks, possibly using the Iris.csv dataset.

Support Vector Machines (svm.ipynb)
This notebook uses Support Vector Machines to classify data from the WineQT.csv dataset.
